#### Aircraft carrier-based fighter jet officially capable of night combat

&emsp;&emsp;The J-15 fighter jet is capable of night takeoff and landing on an aircraft carrier, the Chinese navy newspaper said Wednesday, leading a Chinese military expert to marvel at how fast the pilots mastered a difficult and dangerous technique.

&emsp;&emsp;The People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy has made a breakthrough in its aircraft carrier night takeoff and landing technique, a historic milestone for the J-15 and a significant breakthrough in overall attack and defense capability, the official PLA website navy.81.cn website reported on Wednesday.

&emsp;&emsp;At night during combat, aircraft carriers are likely to dim their lights making takeoff and landing a much more challenging proposition for pilots, Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Thursday.

&emsp;&emsp;Daytime take-off and landing are already difficult and dangerous as a carrier is much smaller than, for example, an airport landing strip, Song said.

&emsp;&emsp;Factor in the harsh sea and weather conditions, and the pilot must learn to face and overcome massive psychological pressure.

&emsp;&emsp;In a recent training session, J-15 pilots took off and landed at night multiple times and finished live-fire target practices with various types of missiles, the report said.

&emsp;&emsp;"Military conflicts do not only break out during daytime, and so it's very important to take nighttime operations into consideration in preparing for a potential war," Song said.

&emsp;&emsp;The fighter jets' abilities to take off and land in all weathers at all times are an important indication that a carrier has developed full combat capabilities, Song noted.

&emsp;&emsp;It took five years for the J-15 to evolve from test flights, pilot training, through flying by day to flying by day and night, navy.81.cn reported.

&emsp;&emsp;Compared to other countries that have aircraft carriers and have practiced the technique for decades, China took only a few years, Song said.
The achievement showed how much PLA pilots had invested in their training, he said.

#### 舰载战斗机正式实现夜间攻防能力

&emsp;&emsp;《中国海军报》于星期三报道，歼-15战斗机实现了夜间飞行和着舰能力，无不让中国军事专家感叹飞行员掌握的这一艰巨技术。

&emsp;&emsp;中国海军网于星期三报道称，中国海军在航母夜行和登陆技术上取得了突破性成就，是歼-15战斗机史上一重要里程碑，是整体战斗和防御能力的一个重要突破。

&emsp;&emsp;宋忠平，军事专家、电视台评论员，于星期四向环球时报讲述，在夜战之际，航空母舰有可能降低灯光度，这样就加大了飞行员起降的风险。

&emsp;&emsp;宋忠平称，由于航母比机场着陆跑道小得多，昼间起降已经存在着困难和危险。

&emsp;&emsp;除了面临恶劣的海况和天气条件，飞行员还必须克服巨大的心理压力。

&emsp;&emsp;报道称，在近期一次训练中，J-15飞行员在夜间多次起降并完成多型导弹实弹射击练习。

&emsp;&emsp;宋忠平称，军事冲突不仅仅会在日间爆发，因此为应对潜在战争，实行夜间实训至关重要。

&emsp;&emsp;宋忠平提到，战斗机在全时全候的起降能力对于航母整体攻防能力的发展起着重要作用。

&emsp;&emsp;据中国海军网报道，歼-15经历了飞行测试，人员演练，昼夜飞行，耗时五年发展而来。

&emsp;&emsp;宋忠平称，与其他拥有航母，经数年技术测试的国家相比，中国仅用了短短几年的时间。

&emsp;&emsp;他称，这一成就彰显了中国人民解放军飞行员英勇奉献的精神。
