&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese President Xi Jinping's first visit to the Eastern Economic Forum (EEF) in Vladivostok in Russia signals a landmark deepening of China-Russia relations and regional cooperation, government officials and business representatives said on Tuesday.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xi arrived in Vladivostok on Tuesday at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin. This was the first time a Chinese head of state had attended the EEF, according to the Xinhua News Agency. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xi and Putin held talks and agreed to promote bilateral ties, and safeguard world peace and stability.

During their discussions Xi said China and Russia should deepen cooperation on projects related to the Belt and Road initiative and with the Eurasian Economic Union, focus on energy, agriculture, high-tech and finance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade between Russia and China reached $87 billion in 2017, and will most likely exceed $100 billion this year, said Putin, adding that the two countries have established trust-based relations on political, security and defense matters, according to kremlin.ru.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China-Russia relations are now at their historic best, Chinese Ambassador to Russia Li Hui said in an article published in the People's Daily on Tuesday. Faced with rising protectionism and unilateralism, China aims to improve regional cooperation and facilitate trade based on the win-win principle, said Li.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Russian officials said Xi's visit is highly important and will further enhance cooperation between the two countries.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a good opportunity for us, and also for China, as we are dealing with sanctions from Western countries and China has trade frictions with the US," Alexander Borisovich Levintal, Governor of the Jewish Autonomous Region, a Russian federal subject that borders Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, told the Global Times.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nikolay Kharitonov, a member of the State Duma, the Russian parliament, also noted that Xi's visit would bring China and Russia closer. "The Russian Far East regional governments are now working on attracting more Chinese investment and looking into cooperation on agricultural projects," Kharitonov told the Global Times.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 7,000 people from more than 60 countries have participated in this year's EEF, which was initially proposed by Putin and has been held annually since 2015. Senior officials from nine Chinese provinces and municipalities, including Heilongjiang, Southwest China's Jiangsu and South China's Guangdong provinces, attended a dialogue with representatives from 13 of Russia's federal subjects on Tuesday to discuss potential projects.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The scale of the dialogue between Chinese and Russian regional leaders is unprecedented, reflecting the Russian government's strong willingness to attract more Chinese investment to the Russian Far East," Chinese business veteran Xue Xingfa, who has done business in Russia for over three decades, told the Global Times. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2018 is the year of China-Russia regional cooperation. The EEF has become another important regional cooperation mechanism linking China and Russia. Others include the Yangtze River-Volga River and China's Northeast-Russia's Far East, said Li.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the support of regional governments from both sides, Russian officials will take potential projects more seriously, Xue said, noting that his company has just signed a deal to import 2 million tons of coal a year from Russia under the enhanced regional cooperation mechanism.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some business representatives at the forum noted that regional partnerships between China and Russia will help fulfill the development goals of the two governments, which aim to revitalize Northeast China and support the Russian Far East development plan.

&emsp;&emsp;政府官员及商业代表于星期二称，国家主席习近平赴俄罗斯符拉迪沃斯托克首次出席东方经济论坛标志着中俄关系以及区域合作的进一步深化。

&emsp;&emsp;应俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔··普京邀请，国家主席习近平于星期二抵达符拉迪沃斯托克。据新华网报道，此次出访，是中国首脑第一次出席东方经济论坛。

&emsp;&emsp;习近平主席与普京总统展开谈话，双方就共促双边关系，维护世界和平与稳定达成一致。

&emsp;&emsp;谈话期间习近平主席提出，中俄双方应深化共建“一带一路”和欧亚经济联盟合作，扩大能源，农业，科技创新，金融等领域合作。

&emsp;&emsp;据克里姆林宫网报道，普京称，2017年中俄贸易额共计870亿美元，预计今年有望超过1000亿美元。普京强调中俄双方已建立政治，安全，国防互信关系。

&emsp;&emsp;星期二，中国驻俄罗斯大使李辉在中国日报一篇专栏中指出，中俄关系站上新的历史起点。李辉强调，面对日渐增长的贸易保护主义和单边主义，中国致力于加强区域合作，建设合作共赢的贸易关系。

&emsp;&emsp;部分俄罗斯官员强调，习近平主席的本次访问对进一步深化中俄两国合作关系具有重要意义。

&emsp;&emsp;犹太自治州（俄罗斯联邦主体，与中国黑龙江省接壤）州长列文塔尔·亚历山大·鲍里索维奇向《环球时报》讲述：“我国面临着来自西方国家的制裁，中国与美国发生贸易摩擦，因此对于中俄双方来说这都是一个良好的机遇。”

&emsp;&emsp;俄罗斯联邦议会下议院-杜马议员尼古拉·哈利托诺夫也称，习近平主席的访问使中俄两国关系更进一步。尼古拉·哈利托诺夫向《环球时报》讲述：“俄罗斯远东地区政府正努力吸引中国投资，寻求农业项目合作。”

&emsp;&emsp;东方经济论坛由俄罗斯总统普京于2015年发起，每年举办一次。今年有60多个国家，超过7000人与会。九名分别来自黑龙江，江苏，广东的中国省级及直辖市高层领导与13名俄罗斯联邦主体代表就潜在合作项目进行会谈。

&emsp;&emsp;中国商业老手薛行发在俄罗斯商界纵横三十余年，他向《环球时报》讲述： “此次中俄地区领导人会晤规模史无前例，反映了俄罗斯政府对中国在远东地区投资的强烈愿望。”

&emsp;&emsp;2018年为中俄区域合作之年。东方经济论坛成为继长江-伏尔加河及中国东北-俄罗斯远东计划之后，连结中俄两国区域合作的又一重要机制。

&emsp;&emsp;薛行方称，在中俄双方区域政府的支持下，俄罗斯高层官员将以更加严谨的态度对待潜在合作项目。他强调，为深化区域合作机制，其公司刚与俄方签署协议，每年进口俄方200万吨煤。

&emsp;&emsp;与会的商业代表称，中俄区域合作关系有助于双方政府实现复兴中国东北，援助俄罗斯远东发展计划的发展目标。
